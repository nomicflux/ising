## Ising Model
The Two Dimensional Ising Model is a basic model in Statistical Mechanics with exact solutions.

However, working through equations is not the same as seeing and interacting with a model, and there is no reason given current technology why these ideas cannot be properly visualized.  

In this web app, the user interacts with a grid of positively- and negatively-charged magnetic particles.  The grid then updates using basic Monte Carlo simulation methods.  The main point is to show how temperature affects the model: at lower temperatures, only isolated regions change charge, while at higher temperatures, the entire grid starts to come together under a single charge.  In addition, the user can view the average time it takes to flip a charge, to see how different temperatures and topologies affect the model.
